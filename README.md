# Soham's Library

📚 **Soham's Library** is a React-based library app built with Vite and TypeScript. It allows users to browse a collection of books, filter by genre, search by title, toggle dark mode, collapse the sidebar, and sort books A–Z or Z–A. The project is an early-stage work-in-progress showcasing hands-on React skills and AI-assisted coding.
